* Kinesis Advantage2 LF: QWERTY adapted

This is a modification of the [[https://github.com/deBaer/qmk_firmware/tree/kintneolike/keyboards/kinesis/keymaps/neolike][neolike by deBaer]] just because it was the first firmware I was flashing. I don't use Neo(2) but I learned from deBaer's customization a lot.

This layout will be decriben in more details soon. I will blog about it on https://Karl-Voit.at - you might like to read:
