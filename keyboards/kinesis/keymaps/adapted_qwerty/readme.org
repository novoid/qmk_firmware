* Kinesis Advantage2 LF: adapted QWERTY 

This is a modification of the [[https://github.com/deBaer/qmk_firmware/tree/kintneolike/keyboards/kinesis/keymaps/neolike][neolike by deBaer]] just because it was
the first firmware I was flashing in my Teensy chip. I don't use
Neo(2) but I learned from deBaer's customization a lot.

The layout will be described in more details soon. I will blog about it
on https://Karl-Voit.at - you might like to read:

** General approach of this layout

Since I refrained from trying an alternative layout like Neo2 or KOY,
I started with standard QWERTY and US international layout with dead
keys.

[[https://karl-voit.at/2021/03/21/advantage2-plans/][I soon found out that the Advantage2 is not well suited for a lot of
keyboard shortcuts I frequently use]]. After writing down all those hard
to type combinations I need, I just added an additional layer by
re-mapping the =End= and the =Page Down= keys as modifiers.

Furthermore, I swapped the position of the minus and the equal keys
since I could not find any argument for them being placed like Kinesis
did but many reasons to swap them.

On the additional layer, I mapped all those hard to reach shortcuts as
straight forward as possible. Please note that the requirements for
your shortcuts are most certain completely different. You might not
want to use my additional layer setup but find out about your
shortcuts that are hard to type in this keyboard.

** How to modify a Kinesis Advantage2 for QMK

I followed [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js5lXJGMgDs][this excellent (German) video]] and ordered [[https://orthkb.work/?product=kint-kinesis-keyboard-controller][the QMK set from his page]] in 2021-03.

The modification went smooth even though I'm not very skilled in soldering.
